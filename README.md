## Note To the Evaluator

With the Use of powerful DevExpress React Grid, we can able to perform  column level search, so instead of your designs, I converted the users flexible User Interface. Through this User can able to Filter the results on row level to entire result set.

On top of Table right corner I provided the select/deselect table column chooser. Through this user can able to control the entire table data display. By default when user logs on this table user can able to see the only  Account No, Acc Name, Currency, Amt, Transaction type. But behind the scene it loaded all the table data.

This Table has pagination controls also there. And I also provided the Export Data to Excel. So on click of Export Download button, entre data can be downloaded on user machine. 

For this I make use of React 16.9, Redux, Material UI, RSAA - redux api middleware, and also all the best features of ES6.

For Demo/Evaluation purpose I'm giving you the developer mode code, as you can able to view the Redux Data in Redux store and also debug the app in console.

And also to give you the complete application architecture, I created the folder structre as application should be configured on each level.

I planned to provide some more features like converting these reports data to Visual charts like Column Chart, Pie Charts using High Charts. But due to time constraints I can't do it.
